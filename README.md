# AiRadar
Demo of an application, that after aiming a plane on the sky with phone camera, allows checking data about machine (for instance airline, speed, altitude etc.). Those data come from JSON file downloaded every few seconds from https://www.flightradar24.com. Application makes calculations of current position of the plane and spotter. It is possible to set coordinates of spotter by inserting certain data or by switching on GPS. 

Project finished in 2012.
